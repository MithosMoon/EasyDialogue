# EasyDialogue
Easy to learn and modify dialogue system for Godot Game Engine

how to install:
Copy all files from folders here into your project folders with the same name.
Keep in mind that Linux differs higher case and lower case.

More:
My dialogue system is not the most elegant solution, but it is easy to understand and can be expanded quickly by simply copying it and is immediately ready for use.

It is ment as an overlay for both, 2D and 3D scenes, has animated texture placeholders and uses the Ubuntu font recource.
It does NOT use timers! The player proceeds though the dialogue, by pressing ui_accept button.

Have Fun and let the Game begin!
